### 💡 Usage Guidelines

#### Creating Coin Animations

**3D/World Space Coins**
```csharp
// Get the coin controller
var coinController = coinObject.GetComponent<CoinAnimationController>();

// Animate movement with easing
coinController.AnimateToPosition(targetPosition, 1.0f);

// Collect with multi-phase animation
coinController.CollectCoin(collectionPoint, 1.5f);

// Stop current animation
coinController.StopCurrentAnimation();
```

**UGUI/Canvas Coins**
```csharp
// Get the UGUI coin controller
var uguiCoinController = coinObject.GetComponent<UGUICoinAnimationController>();

// Animate with RectTransform positioning
uguiCoinController.AnimateToPosition(targetPosition, 1.0f);

// Collect with UI-optimized animation
uguiCoinController.CollectCoin(collectionPoint, 1.5f);
```

#### Animation States
1. **Idle** - Coin is not animating
2. **Moving** - Coin is moving to a target position
3. **Collecting** - Coin is being collected with scale effects
4. **Paused** - Animation temporarily suspended
5. **Pooled** - Coin is ready for reuse

#### Object Pooling
The system includes efficient object pooling for optimal performance:
- `CoinObjectPool` - Manages coin lifecycle and reuse
- `MemoryPoolIntegration` - Integrates pooling with animation system
- Automatic cleanup and resource management
- Configurable pool sizes based on performance needs

#### Multi-Phase Collection Animation
1. **Scale Up** (30% duration): EaseOutBack easing to 1.5x size
2. **Movement** (70% duration): EaseInSine easing to collection point with rotation
3. **Scale Down** (20% duration): EaseInBack easing to 0x size

#### Performance Considerations
- Use coroutine-based animations for best performance
- Limit concurrent coins to maintain 60fps
- Monitor memory usage during extended animations
- Test on target platforms for performance validation

#### UGUI Prefab Creation (Current Task: Story 1.2)
When creating UGUI coin prefabs for the animation system:
1. **Canvas Setup**: Create a Screen Space - Overlay Canvas for UGUI coins
2. **Image Component**: Use Unity UI Image component for visual representation
3. **Component Structure**: Ensure `CoinAnimationController` is attached to the same GameObject
4. **Animation Compatibility**: Verify RectTransform positioning works with coroutine animations
5. **Prefab Standardization**: Create consistent prefab structure for batch spawning

### ⚠️ Important Notes
- **Coroutine-Based**: All animations use Unity's coroutine system with custom mathematical easing
- **Memory Efficient**: Minimal memory footprint for high performance (587 lines of core code)
- **Cross-Platform**: Compatible with all Unity-supported platforms
- **Easy Integration**: Simple API for quick integration into existing projects
- **Zero-Dependency Philosophy**: Demonstrates professional-quality animation without external packages
