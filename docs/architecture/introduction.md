# Introduction

This document outlines the complete architecture for the Gomoku (Five in a Row) game, a Unity-based implementation focused on local two-player gameplay. The architecture is designed to provide a clean, intuitive gaming experience while maintaining the strategic depth of the classic board game.

The system will be built using Unity with C#, following best practices for game development. The architecture emphasizes modularity, testability, and maintainability while focusing on the core gameplay experience without unnecessary complexity.
