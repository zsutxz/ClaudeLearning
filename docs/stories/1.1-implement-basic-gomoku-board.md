# Story 1.1: Implement Basic Gomoku Board

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** player,
**I want** to see a Gomoku board,
**so that** I can play the game.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A 15×15 grid is displayed on the screen
2. The grid is visually distinct with clear intersections
3. The board is centered on the screen
4. The board renders correctly on different screen resolutions

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Create board visualization component (AC: 1, 2)
  - [x] Design grid rendering logic
  - [x] Implement line-based grid visualization
  - [x] Ensure intersections are clearly visible
- [x] Implement board positioning and scaling (AC: 3, 4)
  - [x] Center the board on the screen
  - [x] Implement responsive scaling for different resolutions
  - [x] Test board display on different resolutions
- [x] Create basic scene structure
  - [x] Set up main camera
  - [x] Create board GameObject
  - [x] Configure lighting (if needed)

## Dev Notes
### Component Specifications
- Board should be implemented as a Unity GameObject with a custom script for grid rendering
- Use Unity's LineRenderer or similar components for drawing grid lines
- BoardManager component will handle board state and visualization [Source: architecture/full-stack-architecture.md#4.2 BoardManager]

### File Locations
- Main board script: `Assets/Scripts/BoardManager.cs`
- Board prefab: `Assets/Prefabs/Board.prefab`
- Main scene: `Assets/Scenes/MainGame.unity`

### Technical Constraints
- Use Unity 2022.3 LTS as specified in the tech stack
- Follow component-based architecture as outlined in the architecture document
- Implement singleton pattern for BoardManager for global access [Source: architecture/full-stack-architecture.md#3.2 Component Diagram]

### Testing
- Test board display on different resolutions (AC: 4)
- Verify grid lines are visually distinct (AC: 2)
- Confirm board is centered on screen (AC: 3)
