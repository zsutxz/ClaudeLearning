# Story 3.3: Implement Alternative Win Conditions

## Description

As a player,
I want to play with different win conditions,
so that I can add variety to my gameplay.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Players shall be able to select alternative win conditions (e.g., 6-in-a-row)
2. Alternative win conditions shall be configurable in game settings
3. Win detection shall work correctly with alternative win conditions
4. The default win condition shall remain 5-in-a-row

## Implementation Plan

### Tasks

- [ ] Add win condition selection to settings
- [ ] Implement configurable win detection logic
- [ ] Set 5-in-a-row as default win condition
- [ ] Test alternative win conditions
- [ ] Verify win detection works correctly
- [ ] Ensure settings are properly applied

### Technical Approach

1. Extend settings system to include win condition options
2. Modify win detection algorithm to support variable win conditions
3. Implement UI for win condition selection
4. Test with different win condition values
5. Ensure backward compatibility with default 5-in-a-row
