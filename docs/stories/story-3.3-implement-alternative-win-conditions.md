# Story 3.3: Implement Alternative Win Conditions

## Description
As a player, I want alternative win conditions so that I can add variety to my gameplay.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Players can select from different win conditions (e.g., 3 in a row, 7 in a row)
- Win condition selection is available before starting a game
- Selected win condition is properly applied to the game
- Win detection works correctly with all win conditions

## Tasks
- Create UI for win condition selection
- Implement configurable win detection logic
- Update win validation for different conditions
- Test win detection with different conditions
- Ensure game balance with alternative win conditions

## Estimated Effort
2 days

## Dependencies
- Story 1.3: Implement Win Detection
- Basic understanding of configurable game rules

## Notes
- Consider defaulting to standard 5 in a row
- Ensure all win conditions are playable and balanced
- Test edge cases with shorter and longer win conditions
- Performance should be acceptable with all win conditions
