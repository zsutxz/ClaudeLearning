# Story 1.2: Implement Piece Placement Logic

## Description
As a player, I want to place pieces on the board by clicking so that I can play the game.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Players can place black and white pieces on empty intersections
- Pieces are placed only on valid board positions
- Players take turns placing pieces (black goes first)
- Previously placed pieces cannot be moved or removed
- Visual feedback is provided when hovering over valid positions

## Tasks
- Implement click detection on board intersections
- Create piece placement validation logic
- Implement turn management system
- Add visual feedback for hover states
- Test piece placement with various scenarios

## Estimated Effort
3 days

## Dependencies
- Story 1.1: Implement Basic Gomoku Board
- Basic understanding of Unity event system

## Notes
- Ensure accurate detection of click positions
- Consider edge cases like clicking near board edges
- Visual feedback should be subtle but clear
- Turn management should be robust and handle all game states
