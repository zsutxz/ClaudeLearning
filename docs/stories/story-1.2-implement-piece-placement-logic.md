# Story 1.2: Implement Piece Placement Logic

## Description

As a player,
I want to place pieces on the board by clicking,
so that I can make my moves.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Players shall be able to place pieces only on valid intersection points
2. Players shall alternate turns between black and white pieces
3. Players shall not be able to place pieces on occupied intersections
4. Invalid clicks shall be ignored without error messages

## Implementation Plan

### Tasks

- [ ] Implement click detection on intersection points
- [ ] Create piece placement logic
- [ ] Implement turn alternation between players
- [ ] Prevent placement on occupied intersections
- [ ] Handle invalid clicks gracefully
- [ ] Verify implementation meets all acceptance criteria

### Technical Approach

1. Add click handlers to intersection points
2. Implement game state management for piece placement
3. Create turn management system
4. Add validation for placement rules
5. Test edge cases and invalid inputs

### Dependencies

- Basic Gomoku board implementation (Story 1.1)
