# Story 5.1: Implement Comprehensive Game Testing

## Description
As a developer, I want to implement comprehensive testing so that I can ensure the game is stable and bug-free.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Unit tests are implemented for core game mechanics
- Integration tests are implemented for complete game flow
- Performance benchmarks are established and met
- All critical and high-priority bugs are resolved
- Documentation is complete and follows BMAD methodology

## Tasks
- Develop unit tests for board management
- Develop unit tests for piece placement logic
- Develop unit tests for win detection algorithms
- Develop integration tests for game flow
- Establish performance benchmarks
- Execute all tests and resolve failures
- Document test results and coverage
- Complete all required documentation

## Estimated Effort
1 week

## Dependencies
- All previous epics and stories
- Unity Test Framework
- Established coding standards and documentation guidelines

## Notes
- Test coverage should be comprehensive but practical
- Performance testing should include different board sizes
- Consider edge cases and error conditions in testing
- Documentation should be clear and follow established templates
