# Story 2.1: Implement Game State Display

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** player,
**I want** to see the current game state displayed clearly,
**so that** I know whose turn it is and what's happening in the game.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The current player (black or white) is clearly indicated during gameplay
2. The game state (playing, paused, game over) is visible to the player
3. Visual feedback is provided when the game state changes
4. The display updates immediately when the player changes

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Implement current player display (AC: 1, 4)
  - [x] Create UI text element to show current player
  - [x] Update text when player changes
  - [x] Use distinct visual styling for each player (black/white)
- [x] Implement game state indicators (AC: 2, 3)
  - [x] Create visual indicators for different game states
  - [x] Update indicators when game state changes
  - [x] Provide visual feedback for state transitions
- [x] Integrate with existing game components
  - [x] Connect to GameManager's player change events
  - [x] Connect to GameManager's game state change events
  - [x] Ensure UI updates are responsive and immediate
- [x] Add visual styling and polish
  - [x] Apply consistent styling with overall game UI
  - [x] Ensure text is readable and clearly visible
  - [x] Test display on different screen resolutions

## Dev Notes
### Component Specifications
- Extend the existing UIManager component to handle game state display [Source: architecture/full-stack-architecture.md#4.4 UIManager]
- Use Unity's UI Text component for displaying current player information
- UIManager should subscribe to game events for real-time updates [Source: architecture/full-stack-architecture.md#7.1 Game Events]

### File Locations
- UI management script: `Assets/Scripts/Core/UIManager.cs`
- Main scene: `Assets/Scenes/MainGame.unity`
- UI assets: `Assets/UI/`

### Technical Constraints
- Use Unity 2022.3 LTS as specified in the tech stack [Source: architecture/full-stack-architecture.md#2.1 Primary Technologies]
- Follow component-based architecture as outlined in the architecture document [Source: architecture/full-stack-architecture.md#3.2 Component Diagram]
- Implement singleton pattern for UIManager for global access [Source: architecture/full-stack-architecture.md#4.4 UIManager]
- Use Unity UI Toolkit for creating UI elements [Source: architecture/full-stack-architecture.md#2.1 Primary Technologies]

### Testing
- Test that current player display updates correctly when players switch
- Verify that game state indicators show the correct state
- Confirm that visual feedback is provided during state transitions
- Test display readability on different screen resolutions
