# Story 1.3: Implement Win Detection

## Description

As a player,
I want the game to detect when I get five in a row,
so that I know when I've won.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The system shall detect five consecutive pieces in horizontal direction
2. The system shall detect five consecutive pieces in vertical direction
3. The system shall detect five consecutive pieces in diagonal directions
4. The system shall declare a winner when five in a row is detected

## Implementation Plan

### Tasks

- [ ] Implement horizontal win detection algorithm
- [ ] Implement vertical win detection algorithm
- [ ] Implement diagonal win detection algorithms
- [ ] Create winner declaration system
- [ ] Test all win detection scenarios
- [ ] Verify implementation meets all acceptance criteria

### Technical Approach

1. Develop efficient algorithms to check for five-in-a-row
2. Implement checks in all four directions (horizontal, vertical, two diagonals)
3. Optimize detection to check only around the last placed piece
4. Create system to declare winner and end game
5. Test with various win scenarios

### Dependencies

- Piece placement logic (Story 1.2)
- Game state management understanding
