# Story 3.1: Implement Board Size Options

## Description

As a player,
I want to choose different board sizes,
so that I can play on my preferred board size.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Players shall be able to select from 9x9, 13x13, and 19x19 board sizes
2. The default board size shall be 15x15
3. Changing board size shall take effect when starting a new game
4. Win detection shall work correctly on all supported board sizes

## Implementation Plan

### Tasks

- [ ] Add board size selection to settings
- [ ] Implement multiple board size configurations
- [ ] Ensure win detection works on all board sizes
- [ ] Set 15x15 as default board size
- [ ] Verify board size changes take effect on new game
- [ ] Test all board sizes function correctly

### Technical Approach

1. Extend settings system to include board size options
2. Modify board generation logic to support different sizes
3. Update win detection algorithm for variable board sizes
4. Implement UI for board size selection
5. Test all supported board sizes

### Dependencies

- Settings system implementation
- Basic board implementation (Story 1.1)
- Win detection system (Story 1.3)
