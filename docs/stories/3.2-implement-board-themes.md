# Story 3.2: Implement Board Themes

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** player,
**I want** to select from multiple board themes before starting a game,
**so that** I can customize the visual appearance of my gameplay experience.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Players can select from multiple board themes (Classic, Modern, Nature) before starting a game
2. The selected theme is properly applied to the game board and pieces
3. Game properly handles different themes in gameplay and UI
4. Default theme is Classic if no selection is made

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Implement board theme selection UI (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Create dropdown or button group for theme options
  - [ ] Add visual preview for each theme option
  - [ ] Ensure UI is accessible and user-friendly
- [ ] Implement theme configuration logic (AC: 2, 3)
  - [ ] Update BoardViewManager to support different themes
  - [ ] Modify material and visual properties based on selected theme
  - [ ] Ensure theme changes are applied to all board elements
- [ ] Integrate theme selection with game start (AC: 1, 2, 4)
  - [ ] Pass selected theme to BoardViewManager on game start
  - [ ] Implement default theme handling
  - [ ] Ensure theme is applied before game initialization
- [ ] Update UI elements for different themes (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Verify UI panels and elements match the selected theme
  - [ ] Ensure text and button styling is consistent with theme
  - [ ] Test theme consistency across all game states
- [ ] Testing and validation (All ACs)
  - [ ] Test all themes function correctly
  - [ ] Verify UI displays properly for different themes
  - [ ] Confirm theme changes are applied consistently

## Dev Notes
### Component Specifications
- Extend the existing BoardViewManager component to support different themes [Source: architecture/full-stack-architecture.md#4.2 BoardManager]
- Update UIManager to include theme selection in settings [Source: architecture/full-stack-architecture.md#4.4 UIManager]
- Use Unity UI elements (Dropdown or Toggle Group) for theme selection [Source: architecture/full-stack-architecture.md#2.1 Primary Technologies]

### File Locations
- Main board script: `Assets/Scripts/UI/BoardViewManager.cs`
- UI management script: `Assets/Scripts/UI/UIManager.cs`
- Materials: `Assets/Prefabs/Gomoku/`
- Editor script for asset generation: `Assets/Editor/GenerateGomokuAssets.cs`
- UI prefabs: `Assets/UI/`

### Technical Constraints
- Use Unity 2022.3 LTS as specified in the tech stack [Source: architecture/full-stack-architecture.md#2.1 Primary Technologies]
- Follow component-based architecture as outlined in the architecture document [Source: architecture/full-stack-architecture.md#3.2 Component Diagram]
- Implement singleton pattern for UIManager for global access [Source: architecture/full-stack-architecture.md#4.4 UIManager]
- Support material instancing for better performance with themed pieces [Source: Assets/Editor/GenerateGomokuAssets.cs]

### Testing
- Test all three themes (Classic, Modern, Nature) for proper functionality
- Verify UI displays correctly for different themes
- Confirm theme changes are applied consistently to all board elements
- Test theme persistence between game sessions
- Validate performance with different themes

| Category                             | Status | Issues |
| ------------------------------------ | ------ | ------ |
| 1. Goal & Context Clarity            | PASS   |        |
| 2. Technical Implementation Guidance | PASS   |        |
| 3. Reference Effectiveness           | PASS   |        |
| 4. Self-Containment Assessment       | PASS   |        |
| 5. Testing Guidance                  | PASS   |        |

**Final Assessment:**

- READY: The story provides sufficient context for implementation
- NEEDS REVISION: The story requires updates (see issues)
- BLOCKED: External information required (specify what information)

**Quick Summary:**
- Story readiness: READY
- Clarity score: 9/10
- Major gaps identified: None

**Developer Perspective:**
This story is well-defined and provides sufficient context for implementation. A developer agent should be able to implement this without major issues. The story clearly defines what needs to be built, provides technical guidance on implementation, and includes testing considerations. The only minor improvement might be to add more specific details about the visual styling, but this can be determined during implementation.
