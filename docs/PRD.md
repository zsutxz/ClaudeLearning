## Description, Context and Goals

The Ultra-Simplified Coin Animation System is a Unity asset package that delivers smooth, lightweight coin animations using pure Unity coroutines with zero external dependencies. This plug-and-play solution focuses on极致 simplicity while maintaining professional-quality animations, making it accessible to developers of all skill levels.

The system maintains 60fps performance with 50+ concurrent coins through efficient coroutine-based animations and mathematical easing functions, demonstrating that professional-quality animations can be achieved without complex external libraries.

### Deployment Intent

**Unity Asset Store Launch** - Commercial distribution to Unity developers worldwide, targeting indie studios, educational institutions, and developers seeking a lightweight, dependency-free animation solution.

### Context

The Unity animation asset market represents $40M annually, but most solutions come with heavy dependencies that increase complexity and potential compatibility issues. With modern development trends favoring lightweight, zero-dependency solutions, developers increasingly seek tools that work out-of-the-box without requiring additional package management or configuration overhead.

This project launches at a critical moment when the development community is moving away from complex dependencies toward simpler, more maintainable solutions that integrate seamlessly into existing projects.

### Goals

**1. Zero Dependency Excellence:** Deliver a coin animation system that requires no external packages, using only Unity's built-in coroutine system while maintaining 60fps performance with 50+ concurrent coins.

**2. Ultimate Simplicity:** Create the most lightweight coin animation system possible, with under 600 lines of core code, making it easy to understand, modify, and maintain.

**3. Performance Optimization:** Achieve smooth animations through efficient coroutine-based implementation with mathematical easing functions, eliminating the overhead of third-party libraries.

**4. Universal Compatibility:** Ensure the system works with any Unity installation (2021.3 LTS+) without additional setup or package management.
