# Epic 1: Foundation & Core Gameplay

## Description
Implement the core game mechanics of Gomoku including the game board, piece placement logic, and win detection algorithms.

## Goals
- Create a fully functional 15×15 Gomoku board
- Implement turn-based piece placement for two players
- Develop accurate win condition detection (5 consecutive pieces in any direction)
- Establish the basic game flow and state management

## Business Value
This epic delivers the fundamental gameplay experience that defines the Gomoku game. Without these core mechanics, there would be no playable game.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Players can place pieces on a 15×15 board in turns
- Game correctly identifies when a player has won by getting 5 in a row
- Game properly manages player turns and game state
- Basic game flow works from start to finish
