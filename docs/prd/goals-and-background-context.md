# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
- Deliver a fully functional digital Gomoku (Five in a Row) game built with Unity
- Provide an engaging local multiplayer experience for two players on the same device
- Create a clean, intuitive user interface that focuses on gameplay rather than unnecessary features
- Implement variable board sizes and win conditions to enhance replayability
- Complete the project within 3 months with positive user feedback

## Background Context
The Gomoku Game project addresses the need for a streamlined, visually appealing digital implementation of the classic Five in a Row strategy board game. Traditional Gomoku is played on paper or wooden boards, which can be cumbersome to set up and lack the convenience of digital alternatives. While existing digital versions often suffer from cluttered interfaces, overcomplication, or lack of local multiplayer focus, this project aims to deliver a clean, intuitive digital adaptation that preserves the game's strategic essence while enhancing the user experience through thoughtful design and implementation. The solution differentiates itself by focusing exclusively on local multiplayer experience without the complexity of networking or AI, making it ideal for face-to-face gaming sessions.
