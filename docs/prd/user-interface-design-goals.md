# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision
The user experience should focus on simplicity and accessibility while maintaining the strategic depth of Gomoku. The interface should be clean and uncluttered, putting the focus on gameplay rather than complex menus or features. Visual customization options should be available but not overwhelming.

## Key Interaction Paradigms
- Turn-based interaction with clear visual indication of current player
- Point-and-click piece placement
- Simple menu system for game configuration
- Intuitive restart/new game functionality

## Core Screens and Views
1. Main Menu Screen: Provides access to game settings and starting a new game
2. Game Board Screen: The primary gameplay interface with the Gomoku board
3. Game Settings Screen: Allows customization of board size, themes, and win conditions
4. Game Results Screen: Displays the winner and options to play again or return to menu

## Accessibility
None

## Branding
The game should have a clean, minimalist aesthetic that focuses on the board and pieces without distracting visual elements.

## Target Device and Platforms
Cross-Platform (Windows, macOS)
