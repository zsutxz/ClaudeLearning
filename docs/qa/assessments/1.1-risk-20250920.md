## Risk Summary

### Risk Scores
- Critical (≥9): 0
- High (≥6): 3
- Medium (≥4): 2
- Low (<4): 0

### Key Findings
1. **Primary Risk**: Performance degradation with complex cascade animations (Score: 7)
2. **Secondary Risks**: Memory leaks (Score: 5) and cascade timing (Score: 6)
3. **Well Mitigated**: Most risks have been addressed through object pooling and proper DOTween cleanup

### Recommendations
1. **Monitor**: Performance under heavy cascade load during playtesting
2. **Validate**: Memory usage over extended gameplay sessions
3. **Consider**: Adding configuration options for cascade parameters to allow tuning

## Risk-Based Testing Focus Areas

### High Priority Test Areas (P0-P1)
1. Performance testing with 10+ simultaneous cascades
2. Memory leak validation over extended gameplay
3. Cascade effect timing and visual consistency

### Medium Priority Test Areas (P2)
1. Edge case handling for extreme positions
2. Configuration parameter validation
3. Integration with different Unity build targets
