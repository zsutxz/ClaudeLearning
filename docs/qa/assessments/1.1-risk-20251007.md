# Risk Assessment: Story 1.1 - Implement Basic Gomoku Board

## Assessment Date: 2025-10-07
## Assessor: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Risk Matrix Summary

| Risk Area | Probability | Impact | Severity | Priority |
|-----------|-------------|--------|----------|----------|
| **Incomplete Visual Implementation** | 30% | Medium | Medium | P2 |
| **Performance Bottlenecks** | 20% | Low | Low | P3 |
| **Missing Intersection Points** | 50% | Low | Low | P3 |

## Detailed Risk Analysis

### 1. Incomplete Visual Implementation
- **Probability**: 30% (some methods not fully implemented)
- **Impact**: Medium (minor functionality gaps)
- **Risk Score**: 6/10
- **Description**: The RenderInstancedPieces method in BoardViewManager is empty and needs implementation for optimal performance with many pieces.
- **Mitigation**: Complete the implementation of the RenderInstancedPieces method

### 2. Performance Bottlenecks
- **Probability**: 20% (only affects very large boards)
- **Impact**: Low (minimal effect on user experience)
- **Risk Score**: 4/10
- **Description**: For very large boards (>19x19), the current implementation may have performance issues with many game objects.
- **Mitigation**: Use GPU instancing or other optimization techniques for large boards

### 3. Missing Intersection Points
- **Probability**: 50% (implementation exists but could be improved)
- **Impact**: Low (aesthetic concern)
- **Risk Score**: 5/10
- **Description**: The intersection points are only created for small boards (≤15x15) but could be added for better visual clarity on all board sizes.
- **Mitigation**: Add intersection points for all board sizes with appropriate optimization

## Risk Prioritization

### P2 - Medium (Should Fix)
1. **Incomplete Visual Implementation** - RenderInstancedPieces method needs implementation

### P3 - Low (Nice to Have)
1. **Performance Bottlenecks** - Optimize for very large boards
2. **Missing Intersection Points** - Add intersection points for all board sizes

## Risk Mitigation Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (P2)
- Implement the RenderInstancedPieces method in BoardViewManager for better performance with many pieces

### Short-term Actions (P3)
- Add intersection points for all board sizes with appropriate optimization
- Optimize performance for very large boards using GPU instancing

## Overall Risk Assessment

**Status**: **LOW RISK** - Core functionality is implemented and working
**Recommendation**: Proceed with story completion, address medium priority issues in next iteration

## Quality Impact
- **Functionality**: Good - Core functionality implemented
- **User Experience**: Good - Visual board is displayed correctly
- **Testability**: Good - Existing tests can validate functionality
- **Maintainability**: Good - Code organization follows architecture guidelines
