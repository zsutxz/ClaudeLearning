# Risk Assessment: Story 1.2 - Implement Piece Placement Logic

## Assessment Date: 2025-10-04
## Assessor: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Risk Matrix Summary

| Risk Area | Probability | Impact | Severity | Priority |
|-----------|-------------|--------|----------|----------|
| **Missing UI Component** | 100% | Medium | Medium | P1 |
| **Architectural Dependencies** | 80% | Medium | Medium | P1 |
| **Code Quality Issues** | 60% | Low | Low | P2 |

## Detailed Risk Analysis

### 1. Missing UI Component for Current Player Indication
- **Probability**: 100% (functionality completely absent)
- **Impact**: Medium (affects user experience but game is playable)
- **Risk Score**: 7/10
- **Description**: No visual indication of whose turn it is (AC 4 not implemented)
- **Mitigation**: Create UI component to display current player turn

### 2. Architectural Dependencies on Missing Components
- **Probability**: 80% (InputManager references non-existent BoardViewManager)
- **Impact**: Medium (affects coordinate conversion accuracy)
- **Risk Score**: 6/10
- **Description**: InputManager uses BoardViewManager.cellSize which doesn't exist, falls back to default value
- **Mitigation**: Resolve dependency or implement BoardViewManager

### 3. Code Quality Issues in GameManager
- **Probability**: 60% (methods throw NotImplementedException)
- **Impact**: Low (affects specific functionality but core logic works)
- **Risk Score**: 4/10
- **Description**: GameManager has NotImplementedException methods and duplicate using statements
- **Mitigation**: Fix code quality issues

## Risk Prioritization

### P1 - High (Should Fix Before Completion)
1. **Missing UI Component** - User experience incomplete
2. **Architectural Dependencies** - Coordinate conversion may be inaccurate

### P2 - Medium (Can Fix Later)
1. **Code Quality Issues** - Technical debt but functional

## Positive Risk Mitigation Factors

### Strong Implementation Areas:
- **InputManager**: Robust click-to-coordinate conversion with fallback
- **BoardManager**: Comprehensive validation and boundary checking
- **GameManager**: Proper player switching and event handling
- **Testing**: Comprehensive unit tests exist
- **Performance**: Efficient raycasting and optimizations

## Risk Mitigation Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (P1)
- Create UI component for current player turn indication
- Resolve BoardViewManager dependency in InputManager

### Short-term Actions (P2)
- Fix GameManager code quality issues
- Add visual feedback for piece placement

## Overall Risk Assessment

**Status**: **MEDIUM RISK** - Core functionality implemented but user experience incomplete
**Recommendation**: Proceed with caution - address UI components before considering complete

## Quality Impact
- **Functionality**: Good - core piece placement works correctly
- **User Experience**: Poor - missing current player indication
- **Testability**: Good - comprehensive unit tests exist
- **Maintainability**: Fair - some technical debt present
