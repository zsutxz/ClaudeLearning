# Requirements Traceability Matrix

## Story: 1.1 - Implement Basic Gomoku Board

### Coverage Summary

- **Total Requirements**: 4
- **Fully Covered**: 0 (0%)
- **Partially Covered**: 0 (0%)
- **Not Covered**: 4 (100%)

### Requirement Mappings

#### AC1: A 15×15 grid is displayed on the screen

**Coverage: NONE**

**Given-When-Then Mappings:**

- **No tests found** for visual grid display functionality
- **Current implementation**: BoardManager.cs only handles game logic state, no visual rendering

**Test Gap Analysis:**
- No unit tests for grid rendering logic
- No integration tests for visual component interaction
- No E2E tests for visual board display

#### AC2: The grid is visually distinct with clear intersections

**Coverage: NONE**

**Given-When-Then Mappings:**

- **No tests found** for visual distinction or intersection clarity
- **Current implementation**: No visual components implemented

**Test Gap Analysis:**
- No visual regression tests
- No UI component tests
- No accessibility tests for visual clarity

#### AC3: The board is centered on the screen

**Coverage: NONE**

**Given-When-Then Mappings:**

- **No tests found** for board positioning or centering
- **Current implementation**: No positioning logic implemented

**Test Gap Analysis:**
- No layout tests
- No responsive design tests
- No screen coordinate validation

#### AC4: The board renders correctly on different screen resolutions

**Coverage: NONE**

**Given-When-Then Mappings:**

- **No tests found** for responsive rendering or resolution handling
- **Current implementation**: No scaling or resolution logic implemented

**Test Gap Analysis:**
- No multi-resolution testing
- No responsive scaling tests
- No cross-device compatibility tests

### Existing Test Coverage Analysis

#### BoardManagerUnitTest.cs
**What it actually tests:**
- Board initialization with different sizes
- Piece placement logic
- Position validation
- Board operations (clear, reset)
- Edge cases for different board sizes

**Given-When-Then for existing tests:**

- **TestBoardInitialization**:
  - Given: GameManager with BoardManager component
  - When: Board is initialized with different sizes
  - Then: Board state array has correct dimensions and is empty

- **TestPiecePlacement**:
  - Given: Empty board
  - When: Pieces are placed at various positions
  - Then: Pieces are correctly recorded in board state

- **TestPositionValidation**:
  - Given: Board with boundary coordinates
  - When: Invalid positions are accessed
  - Then: Methods return appropriate error values

**Coverage Mismatch:**
- All existing tests cover **game logic** functionality
- No tests cover **visual display** requirements
- Tests assume visual components exist but they don't

### Critical Gaps

1. **Visual Board Implementation**
   - Gap: No visual grid rendering component
   - Risk: High - Core functionality missing
   - Action: Create BoardViewManager with Unity LineRenderer

2. **Visual Testing Framework**
   - Gap: No tests for visual components
   - Risk: High - Cannot validate visual requirements
   - Action: Implement visual regression and UI testing

3. **Responsive Design Testing**
   - Gap: No multi-resolution testing
   - Risk: Medium - May not work on different devices
   - Action: Add resolution-specific test scenarios

### Test Design Recommendations

Based on gaps identified, recommend:

#### Immediate (P0)
1. **Create BoardViewManager component**
   - Implement grid visualization with LineRenderer
   - Add intersection markers
   - Implement centering logic
   - Add responsive scaling

2. **Add visual unit tests**
   - Test grid line rendering
   - Test intersection visibility
   - Test board positioning

3. **Add integration tests**
   - Test BoardManager ↔ BoardViewManager interaction
   - Test resolution change handling

#### Short-term (P1)
1. **Add E2E visual tests**
   - Test complete board display workflow
   - Test different screen resolutions
   - Test visual clarity and distinction

2. **Add performance tests**
   - Test rendering performance
   - Test scaling performance

#### Long-term (P2)
1. **Add accessibility tests**
   - Test color contrast
   - Test visual distinction for color blindness

### Risk Assessment

- **High Risk**: All visual requirements have no coverage
- **Impact**: Game is unplayable without visual board
- **Probability**: 100% - functionality completely absent
- **Priority**: P0 - Must fix before completion

### Traceability Status

**Overall Status: CRITICAL GAPS**

- 0% of visual requirements covered
- 100% of requirements have no test coverage
- Core functionality missing from implementation

### Required Actions

1. **Implement missing visual components**
2. **Create visual testing framework**
3. **Add comprehensive visual test coverage**
4. **Re-evaluate traceability after implementation**

### Notes

The current implementation focuses entirely on game logic (piece placement, win detection) but completely misses the visual board display requirements. The existing BoardManagerUnitTest.cs tests game logic functionality but does not address any of the visual requirements specified in the story acceptance criteria.
