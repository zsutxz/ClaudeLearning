# @fileoverview Multi-Speaker Voice Registry - Maps speaker names to ONNX models and speaker IDs
# @context Enables individual speaker selection from multi-speaker Piper models (e.g., 16Speakers)
# @architecture Static registry mapping speaker names to model files and numeric speaker IDs
# @dependencies piper-voice-manager.sh (voice storage), play-tts-piper.sh (TTS with speaker ID)
# @entrypoints Sourced by voice-manager.sh for multi-speaker voice switching
# @patterns Registry pattern, speaker ID mapping, model-to-speaker association
# @related voice-manager.sh, play-tts-piper.sh, 16Speakers.onnx.json (speaker_id_map)
#

# Bash 3.2 compatible lowercase function (macOS ships with bash 3.2)
# ${var,,} syntax requires bash 4.0+
