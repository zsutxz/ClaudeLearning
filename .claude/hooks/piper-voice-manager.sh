# @fileoverview Piper Voice Model Management - Downloads, caches, and validates Piper ONNX voice models
# @context Voice model lifecycle management for free offline Piper TTS provider
# @architecture HuggingFace repository integration with local caching, global storage for voice models
# @dependencies curl (downloads), piper binary (TTS synthesis)
# @entrypoints Sourced by play-tts-piper.sh, piper-download-voices.sh, and provider management commands
# @patterns HuggingFace model repository integration, file-based caching (~25MB per voice), global storage
# @related play-tts-piper.sh, piper-download-voices.sh, provider-manager.sh, GitHub Issue #25
#

# Base URL for Piper voice models on HuggingFace
PIPER_VOICES_BASE_URL="https://huggingface.co/rhasspy/piper-voices/resolve/main"

# AI NOTE: Voice storage precedence order:
# 1. PIPER_VOICES_DIR environment variable (highest priority)
# 2. Project-local .claude/piper-voices-dir.txt
# 3. Directory tree search for .claude/piper-voices-dir.txt
# 4. Global ~/.claude/piper-voices-dir.txt
# 5. Default ~/.claude/piper-voices (fallback)
# This allows per-project voice isolation while defaulting to shared global storage.

# @intent Determine directory for storing Piper voice models with precedence chain
# @why Voice models are large (~25MB each) and should be shared globally by default, but allow per-project overrides
