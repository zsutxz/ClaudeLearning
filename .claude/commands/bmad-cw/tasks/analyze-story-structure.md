- Five-act structure
- Hero's Journey
- Save the Cat beats
- Freytag's Pyramid
- Kishōtenketsu
- In medias res
- Non-linear/experimental

### 2. Map Key Points

- **Opening**: Hook, world establishment, character introduction
- **Inciting Incident**: What disrupts the status quo?
- **Plot Point 1**: What locks in the conflict?
- **Midpoint**: What reversal/revelation occurs?
- **Plot Point 2**: What raises stakes to maximum?
- **Climax**: How does central conflict resolve?
- **Resolution**: What new equilibrium emerges?

### 3. Analyze Pacing

- Scene length distribution
- Tension escalation curve
- Breather moment placement
- Action/reflection balance

- List all subplots
- Track intersection with main plot
- Evaluate resolution satisfaction
- Check thematic reinforcement

### 6. Generate Report
