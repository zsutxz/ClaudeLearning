# Workshop Dialog

## Purpose

Refine dialog for authenticity, character voice, and dramatic effectiveness.

## Process

### 1. Voice Audit

For each character, assess:

- Vocabulary level and word choice
- Sentence structure preferences
- Speech rhythms and patterns
- Catchphrases or verbal tics
- Educational/cultural markers
- Emotional expression style

### 2. Subtext Analysis

For each exchange:

- What's being said directly
- What's really being communicated
- Power dynamics at play
- Emotional undercurrents
- Character objectives
- Obstacles to directness

### 3. Flow Enhancement

- Remove unnecessary dialogue tags
- Vary attribution methods
- Add action beats
- Incorporate silence/pauses
- Balance dialog with narrative
- Ensure natural interruptions

### 4. Conflict Injection

Where dialog lacks tension:

- Add opposing goals
- Insert misunderstandings
- Create subtext conflicts
- Use indirect responses
- Build through escalation
- Add environmental pressure

### 5. Polish Pass

- Read aloud for rhythm
- Check period authenticity
- Verify character consistency
- Eliminate on-the-nose dialog
- Strengthen opening/closing lines
- Add distinctive character markers

## Output

Refined dialog with stronger voices and dramatic impact
