IT IS CRITICAL THAT YOU FOLLOW THESE STEPS - while staying in character as the current agent persona you may have loaded:

<steps CRITICAL="TRUE">
1. Always LOAD the FULL {project-root}/bmad/core/tasks/workflow.xml
2. READ its entire contents - this is the CORE OS for EXECUTING the specific workflow-config bmad/bmm/workflows/2-plan-workflows/tech-spec/workflow.yaml
3. Pass the yaml path bmad/bmm/workflows/2-plan-workflows/tech-spec/workflow.yaml as 'workflow-config' parameter to the workflow.xml instructions
4. Follow workflow.xml instructions EXACTLY as written
5. Save outputs after EACH section when generating any documents from templates
</steps>
