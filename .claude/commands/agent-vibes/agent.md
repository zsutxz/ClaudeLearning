# Agent Vibes - Role-Based AI Agents

Activate a specialized AI agent with a specific professional role and expertise. Unlike personalities (which change speaking style), agents embody complete professional roles with domain-specific knowledge, methodologies, and coaching frameworks.

## Available Agents

### `/agent-vibes:agent negotiator`
**Role**: Expert Negotiation Coach
**Inspired by**: [Chris Voss](https://www.blackswanltd.com/) - Former FBI hostage negotiator
**Specialty**: Tactical empathy, calibrated questions, and psychological techniques for winning negotiations
**Use for**: Salary negotiations, business deals, conflict resolution, difficult conversations

### `/agent-vibes:agent health-coach`
**Role**: Holistic Health & Metabolic Coach
**Inspired by**: [Ben Azadi](https://benazadi.com/) - Keto expert and functional health practitioner
**Specialty**: Ketogenic nutrition, metabolic flexibility, intermittent fasting, sustainable wellness
**Use for**: Weight loss, energy optimization, metabolic health, nutrition guidance

### `/agent-vibes:agent motivator`
**Role**: Peak Performance & Accountability Coach
**Inspired by**: Tony Robbins, David Goggins, Mel Robbins, Les Brown
**Specialty**: State management, mental toughness, massive action, destroying limiting beliefs
**Use for**: Overcoming procrastination, building momentum, achieving goals, personal transformation

## How Agents Work

1. **Slash Command**: Type `/agent-vibes:agent <name>` to activate an agent
2. **Agent Context**: The AI loads the agent's complete professional framework
3. **Specialized Guidance**: You receive expert coaching in that domain
4. **Persistent Session**: The agent role continues until you deactivate it

## Example Usage

```bash
# Activate negotiator for salary discussion
/agent-vibes:agent negotiator
"I need help negotiating my salary offer..."

# Switch to health coach for wellness goals
/agent-vibes:agent health-coach
"I want to lose weight and improve my energy..."

# Get motivated to overcome procrastination
/agent-vibes:agent motivator
"I keep putting off starting my business..."
```

## Agent vs Personality

| Feature | Agents | Personalities |
|---------|--------|---------------|
| **Purpose** | Professional role with domain expertise | Speaking style and tone |
| **Content** | Structured frameworks and methodologies | Emotional flavor and character |
| **Depth** | Deep domain knowledge and coaching | Surface-level style changes |
| **Examples** | Negotiator, Health Coach, Motivator | Sarcastic, Flirty, Pirate |
| **Use Case** | Solve specific problems | Make interactions entertaining |

You can combine both! For example:
- `/agent-vibes:agent negotiator` + `/agent-vibes:personality professional`
- `/agent-vibes:agent motivator` + `/agent-vibes:personality intense`

## Deactivating an Agent

Simply start a new conversation or explicitly state: "Exit agent mode" or "Return to normal mode"
