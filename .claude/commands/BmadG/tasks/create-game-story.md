# /create-game-story Task

When this command is used, execute the following task:

# Create Game Story Task

## Purpose

To identify the next logical game story based on project progress and epic definitions, and then to prepare a comprehensive, self-contained, and actionable story file using the `Game Story Template`. This task ensures the story is enriched with all necessary technical context, Godot-specific requirements (node architecture, GDScript/C# language selection, 60+ FPS performance targets), TDD test requirements, and acceptance criteria, making it ready for efficient implementation by a Game Developer Agent with minimal need for additional research or finding its own context.

## SEQUENTIAL Task Execution (Do not proceed until current Task is complete)

### 0. Load Core Configuration and Check Workflow

- Load `.bmad-godot-game-dev/config.yaml` from the project root
- If the file does not exist, HALT and inform the user: "core-config.yaml not found. This file is required for story creation. You can either: 1) Copy core-config.yaml from GITHUB bmad-core/ and configure it for your game project OR 2) Run the BMad installer against your project to upgrade and add the file automatically. Please add and configure before proceeding."
- Extract key configurations: `devStoryLocation`, `prd.*`, `architecture.*`, `workflow.*`

### 1. Identify Next Story for Preparation

#### 1.1 Locate Epic Files and Review Existing Stories

- Based on `prdSharded` from config, locate epic files (sharded location/pattern or monolithic PRD sections)
- If `devStoryLocation` has story files, load the highest `{epicNum}.{storyNum}.story.md` file
- **If highest story exists:**
  - Verify status is 'Done'. If not, alert user: "ALERT: Found incomplete story! File: {lastEpicNum}.{lastStoryNum}.story.md Status: [current status] Check if TDD tests are passing (GUT/GoDotTest). You should fix this story first, but would you like to accept risk & override to create the next story in draft?"
  - If proceeding, select next sequential story in the current epic
  - If epic is complete, prompt user: "Epic {epicNum} Complete: All stories in Epic {epicNum} have been completed. Would you like to: 1) Begin Epic {epicNum + 1} with story 1 2) Select a specific story to work on 3) Cancel story creation"
  - **CRITICAL**: NEVER automatically skip to another epic. User MUST explicitly instruct which story to create.
- **If no story files exist:** The next story is ALWAYS 1.1 (first story of first epic)
- Announce the identified story to the user: "Identified next story for preparation: {epicNum}.{storyNum} - {Story Title}"

### 2. Gather Story Requirements and Previous Story Context

- Extract story requirements from the identified epic file or PRD section
- If previous story exists, review Dev Agent Record sections for:
  - Completion Notes and Debug Log References
  - Implementation deviations and technical decisions
  - Godot-specific challenges (node structure, signal connections, 60+ FPS violations)
  - Language decisions (GDScript vs C# choices and rationale)
  - Resource loading and object pooling implementations
  - TDD test coverage and any failing tests
- Extract relevant insights that inform the current story's preparation

### 3. Gather Architecture Context

#### 3.1 Determine Architecture Reading Strategy

- **If `architectureVersion: >= v3` and `architectureSharded: true`**: Read `{architectureShardedLocation}/index.md` then follow structured reading order below
- **Else**: Use monolithic `architectureFile` for similar sections

#### 3.2 Read Architecture Documents Based on Story Type

**For ALL Game Stories:** tech-stack.md, godot-project-structure.md, coding-standards.md, test-strategy and standards.md, language-strategy.md

**For Gameplay/Mechanics Stories, additionally:** gameplay-systems-architecture.md, node-architecture-details.md, physics-configuration.md, input-system-architecture.md, state-machine-architecture.md, resource-architecture.md

**For UI/UX Stories, additionally:** node-architecture-details.md, ui-architecture.md, ui-component-system.md, ui-state-management.md, scene-management-architecture.md

**For Backend/Services Stories, additionally:** resource-architecture.md, data-persistence-architecture.md, save-system-implementation.md, analytics-integration.md, multiplayer-architecture.md

**For Graphics/Rendering Stories, additionally:** rendering-settings.md, shader-guidelines.md, sprite-management.md, particle-systems.md

**For Audio Stories, additionally:** audio-architecture.md, audio-mixing-configuration.md, sound-bank-management.md

#### 3.3 Extract Story-Specific Technical Details

Extract ONLY information directly relevant to implementing the current story. Do NOT invent new patterns, systems, or standards not in the source documents.

Extract:

- Specific Godot nodes and their inheritance hierarchy
- Language selection rationale (GDScript vs C# for each component)
- Node composition patterns and signal connections
- Scene (.tscn) and resource (.tres) organization requirements
- InputMap actions and device handling configurations
- Physics2D/3D settings and collision layers
- Control node anchoring and theme specifications
- Resource naming conventions and folder structures
- Performance budgets (60+ FPS minimum, frame time <16.67ms, draw calls)
- Platform export settings (desktop, mobile, web)
- TDD requirements with GUT (GDScript) and GoDotTest (C#)

ALWAYS cite source documents: `[Source: architecture/{filename}.md#{section}]`

### 4. Godot-Specific Technical Analysis

#### 4.1 Language Strategy Analysis

- Determine GDScript vs C# selection for each system based on:
  - Performance requirements (C# for compute-heavy operations)
  - Iteration speed needs (GDScript for rapid prototyping)
  - Existing codebase patterns
- Document static typing enforcement in GDScript (10-20% performance gain)
- Identify interop boundaries between GDScript and C#
- Note any GDExtension or plugin requirements
- Specify object pooling needs for spawned entities

#### 4.2 Scene and Node Planning

- Identify which scenes (.tscn) will be modified or created
- List scene inheritance and composition patterns
- Document node tree structure with parent-child relationships
