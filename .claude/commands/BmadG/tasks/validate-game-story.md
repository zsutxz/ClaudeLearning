# /validate-game-story Task

When this command is used, execute the following task:

# Validate Game Story Task

## Purpose

To comprehensively validate a Godot game development story draft before implementation begins, ensuring it contains all necessary Godot-specific technical context (node architecture, GDScript/C# language strategy, 60+ FPS performance targets), TDD requirements (GUT/GoDotTest), and implementation details. This specialized validation prevents hallucinations, ensures Godot development readiness, and validates game-specific acceptance criteria and testing approaches.

## SEQUENTIAL Task Execution (Do not proceed until current Task is complete)

### 0. Load Core Configuration and Inputs

- Load `.bmad-godot-game-dev/config.yaml` from the project root
