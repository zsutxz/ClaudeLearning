# /review-game-story Task

When this command is used, execute the following task:

# review-game-story

Perform a comprehensive Godot game story review with quality gate decision, focusing on TDD compliance, 60+ FPS performance validation, and GDScript/C# language strategy. This adaptive, risk-aware review creates both a story update and a detailed gate file.

## Inputs

```yaml
required:
  - story_id: '{epic}.{story}' # e.g., "1.3"
  - story_path: '{devStoryLocation}/{epic}.{story}.*.md' # Path from core-config.yaml
  - story_title: '{title}' # If missing, derive from story file H1
  - story_slug: '{slug}' # If missing, derive from title (lowercase, hyphenated)
```

## Prerequisites

- Story status must be "Review"
- Developer has completed all tasks and updated the File List
- All GUT (GDScript) and GoDotTest (C#) tests are passing
- Performance profiler shows 60+ FPS maintained
- TDD cycle (Red-Green-Refactor) was followed

## Review Process - Adaptive Test Architecture

### 1. Risk Assessment (Determines Review Depth)

**Auto-escalate to deep review when:**

- Performance drops below 60 FPS
- No TDD tests written (GUT/GoDotTest)
- Language strategy violated (wrong GDScript/C# choice)
- Object pooling missing for spawned entities
- Diff > 500 lines
- Previous gate was FAIL/CONCERNS
- Story has > 5 acceptance criteria
- Signal connections not properly cleaned up

### 2. Comprehensive Analysis

**A. Requirements Traceability**

- Map each acceptance criteria to GUT/GoDotTest tests
- Verify TDD was followed (tests written first)
- Identify coverage gaps (target 80% minimum)
- Verify all Godot nodes have corresponding test cases
- Check signal emission tests exist

**B. Code Quality Review**

- Node architecture and scene composition
- GDScript static typing enforcement (10-20% perf gain)
- C# optimization patterns (no LINQ, no allocations)
- Signal connection patterns
- Object pooling implementation
- Resource preloading vs lazy loading
- Godot best practices adherence
- Performance profiler validation (60+ FPS)

**C. Test Architecture Assessment**

- GUT test coverage for GDScript components
- GoDotTest coverage for C# components
- TDD compliance (Red-Green-Refactor cycle)
- Scene testing with test doubles
- Signal testing patterns
- Node mocking appropriateness
- Edge case and error scenario coverage
- Test execution performance impact

**D. Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)**

- Performance: 60+ FPS maintained, frame time <16.67ms
- Memory: Scene memory usage, object pooling
- Draw Calls: Within platform budgets
- Platform Compatibility: Export template validation
- Input Latency: <50ms for player controls
- Load Times: Scene transitions <3 seconds
- Reliability: Signal cleanup, node lifecycle

**E. Godot Testability Evaluation**

- Node Testability: Can nodes be tested in isolation?
- Signal Observability: Can signal emissions be verified?
- Scene Testing: Can scenes be tested without full game?
- Performance Testing: Can FPS be validated in tests?
- Platform Testing: Export templates testable?

**F. Technical Debt Identification**

- Missing TDD tests (GUT/GoDotTest)
- Dynamic typing in GDScript (performance debt)
- Missing object pools for spawned entities
- Unoptimized node trees
- Signal connection leaks
- Wrong language choice (GDScript vs C#)
- Performance bottlenecks below 60 FPS

### 3. Active Refactoring

- Add static typing to GDScript where missing
- Optimize C# code (remove LINQ, allocations)
- Implement object pooling for spawned entities
- Run GUT/GoDotTest to ensure changes don't break
- Profile to verify 60+ FPS maintained
- Document all changes in QA Results section
- Do NOT alter story content beyond QA Results section
- Do NOT change story Status or File List

### 4. Standards Compliance Check

- Verify adherence to Godot coding standards
- Check static typing in all GDScript
- Validate C# optimization patterns (no LINQ)
- Verify TDD approach (tests written first)
- Check node naming conventions
- Validate signal naming patterns
- Ensure 60+ FPS performance targets met
- Verify language strategy decisions

### 5. Acceptance Criteria Validation

- Verify each AC is fully implemented
- Check TDD tests exist for each AC
- Validate performance within 60+ FPS
- Verify object pooling where needed
- Check platform export compatibility
- Validate input handling across devices

### 6. Documentation and Comments

- Verify GDScript documentation comments
- Check C# XML documentation
- Ensure export variables have tooltips
- Document performance optimizations
- Note language choice rationale
- Document signal flow and connections

## Output 1: Update Story File - QA Results Section ONLY

**CRITICAL**: You are ONLY authorized to update the "QA Results" section of the story file. DO NOT modify any other sections.

**QA Results Anchor Rule:**

- If `## QA Results` doesn't exist, append it at end of file
- If it exists, append a new dated entry below existing entries
- Never edit other sections

After review and any refactoring, append your results to the story file in the QA Results section:

```

### Gate Decision Criteria

**Deterministic rule (apply in order):**

If risk_summary exists, apply its thresholds first (≥9 → FAIL, ≥6 → CONCERNS), then NFR statuses, then top_issues severity.

1. **Risk thresholds (if risk_summary present):**
   - If any risk score ≥ 9 → Gate = FAIL (unless waived)
   - Else if any score ≥ 6 → Gate = CONCERNS

2. **Test coverage gaps (if trace available):**
   - If any P0 test from test-design is missing → Gate = CONCERNS
   - If security/data-loss P0 test missing → Gate = FAIL

3. **Issue severity:**
   - If any `top_issues.severity == high` → Gate = FAIL (unless waived)
   - Else if any `severity == medium` → Gate = CONCERNS

4. **NFR statuses:**
   - If any NFR status is FAIL → Gate = FAIL
   - Else if any NFR status is CONCERNS → Gate = CONCERNS
   - Else → Gate = PASS

- WAIVED only when waiver.active: true with reason/approver

Detailed criteria:

- **PASS**: All critical requirements met, no blocking issues
- **CONCERNS**: Non-critical issues found, team should review
- **FAIL**: Critical issues that should be addressed
- **WAIVED**: Issues acknowledged but explicitly waived by team

### Quality Score Calculation

```text
quality_score = 100 - (20 × number of FAILs) - (10 × number of CONCERNS)
Bounded between 0 and 100
```

If `technical-preferences.md` defines custom weights, use those instead.

### Suggested Owner Convention

For each issue in `top_issues`, include a `suggested_owner`:

- `dev`: Code changes needed
- `sm`: Requirements clarification needed
- `po`: Business decision needed

## Key Principles

- You are a Godot Game Test Architect ensuring 60+ FPS and TDD compliance
- You enforce static typing in GDScript and optimization in C#
- You have authority to add object pooling and optimize performance
- Always validate with Godot profiler data
- Focus on performance-based prioritization
- Ensure GUT/GoDotTest coverage meets 80% target
- Provide actionable Godot-specific recommendations

## Blocking Conditions

Stop the review and request clarification if:

- Performance drops below 60 FPS
- No TDD tests (GUT/GoDotTest) exist
- Story file is incomplete or missing critical sections
- File List is empty or clearly incomplete
- Language strategy violated without justification
- Object pooling missing for frequently spawned entities
- Critical node architecture issues that require discussion

## Completion

After review:

1. Update the QA Results section in the story file
2. Create the gate file in `docs/qa/gates/`
3. Recommend status: "Ready for Done" or "Changes Required" (owner decides)
4. If files were modified, list them in QA Results and ask Dev to update File List
5. Always provide constructive feedback and actionable recommendations
