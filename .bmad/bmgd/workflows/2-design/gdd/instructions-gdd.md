# GDD Workflow - Game Projects (All Levels)

<workflow>

<critical>The workflow execution engine is governed by: {project_root}/.bmad/core/tasks/workflow.xml</critical>
<critical>You MUST have already loaded and processed: {installed_path}/workflow.yaml</critical>
<critical>Communicate all responses in {communication_language} and language MUST be tailored to {user_skill_level}</critical>
<critical>Generate all documents in {document_output_language}</critical>
<critical>This is the GDD instruction set for GAME projects - replaces PRD with Game Design Document</critical>
<critical>Project analysis already completed - proceeding with game-specific design</critical>
<critical>Uses gdd_template for GDD output, game_types.csv for type-specific sections</critical>
<critical>Routes to 3-solutioning for architecture (platform-specific decisions handled there)</critical>
<critical>If users mention technical details, append to technical_preferences with timestamp</critical>

<critical>DOCUMENT OUTPUT: Concise, clear, actionable game design specs. Use tables/lists over prose. User skill level ({user_skill_level}) affects conversation style ONLY, not document content.</critical>
<critical>⚠️ CHECKPOINT PROTOCOL: After EVERY <template-output> tag, you MUST follow workflow.xml substep 2c: SAVE content to file immediately → SHOW checkpoint separator (━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━) → DISPLAY generated content → PRESENT options [a]Advanced Elicitation/[c]Continue/[p]Party-Mode/[y]YOLO → WAIT for user response. Never batch saves or skip checkpoints.</critical>

## Input Document Discovery

This workflow requires: game brief, and may reference market research or brownfield project documentation.

**Discovery Process** (execute for each referenced document):

1. **Search for whole document first** - Use fuzzy file matching to find the complete document
2. **Check for sharded version** - If whole document not found, look for `{doc-name}/index.md`
3. **If sharded version found**:
   - Read `index.md` to understand the document structure
   - Read ALL section files listed in the index
   - Treat the combined content as if it were a single document
4. **Brownfield projects**: The `document-project` workflow always creates `{output_folder}/index.md`

**Priority**: If both whole and sharded versions exist, use the whole document.

**Fuzzy matching**: Be flexible with document names - users may use variations in naming conventions.

The GDD workflow can run standalone or as part of the BMM workflow path.

- Project context tracking
- Workflow sequencing guidance
- Progress monitoring across workflows

**Or continue standalone** without progress tracking.

Since this is a Level {{project_level}} game project, you need solutioning for platform/engine architecture.

**Start new chat with solutioning workflow and provide:**

1. This GDD: `{{gdd_output_file}}`
2. Project analysis: `{{analysis_file}}`

**The solutioning workflow will:**

- Determine game engine/platform (Unity, Godot, Phaser, custom, etc.)
- Generate architecture.md with engine-specific decisions
- Create per-epic tech specs
- Handle platform-specific architecture (from registry.csv game-\* entries)
