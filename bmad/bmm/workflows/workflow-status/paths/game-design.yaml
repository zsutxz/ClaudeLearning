  🎮 **GAME DEVELOPMENT DETECTED**

  Game development workflows are now part of the **BMad Game Development (BMGD)** module,
  which provides specialized workflows and agents for game creation.

  **To proceed with game development:**

  1. Install the BMGD module:
     ```bash
     bmad install bmgd
     ```

  2. The BMGD module includes:
     - Game Designer, Game Developer, Game Architect agents
     - Game Dev Scrum Master for sprint coordination
     - Industry-standard game dev workflows:
       • Phase 1 (Preproduction): brainstorm-game, game-brief
       • Phase 2 (Design): GDD, narrative design
       • Phase 3 (Technical): game architecture
       • Phase 4 (Production): sprint planning, story management

  3. After installation, load the Game Designer or Game Dev Scrum Master agent
     to begin your game development workflow

  **Why a separate module?**
  - Game development follows different phases than software development
  - Specialized agents understand game-specific terminology and patterns
  - Workflows configured for game development needs (playtesting, balancing, etc.)
  - Can be used standalone or alongside BMM for complete coverage
