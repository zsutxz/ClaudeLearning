🎮 **GAME DEVELOPMENT DETECTED**

Game development workflows are now part of the **BMad Game Development (BMGD)** module.

The BMM module is designed for software development. For game development, you'll need
the BMGD module which provides specialized game development workflows and agents.

**Would you like to:**
a) Install BMGD module now (recommended for game projects)
b) Continue with BMM workflows (for software projects only)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

<ask>Your choice [a/b]:</ask>

  <check if="choice == a">
    <output>
    Please run the following command to install the BMGD module:

    ```bash
    bmad install bmgd
    ```

    After installation, you can start your game development workflow with the Game Designer agent.

    This workflow-init will now exit. Re-run it after installing BMGD.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🚀 **BMad Quick Flow** - Fast Implementation Path

⏱️ **Time:** Hours to 1 day of planning
📝 **Approach:** Tech-spec focused - just enough detail to start coding
✅ **Best for:** Simple features, bug fixes, scope is crystal clear
⚠️ **Trade-off:** Less upfront planning = higher risk of rework if complexity emerges
🤖 **Agent Support:** Basic - AI will have minimal context

**Example:** "Fix login bug" or "Add export button"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🎯 **BMad Method** - Full Product Planning (RECOMMENDED)

⏱️ **Time:** 1-3 days of planning
📝 **Approach:** PRD + UX + Architecture - complete product and system design
✅ **Best for:**

- **GREENFIELD:** Products, platforms, multi-feature initiatives
- **BROWNFIELD:** Complex additions (new UIs + APIs, major refactors, new modules)

✅ **Benefits:**

- AI agents have COMPLETE context for better code generation
- Architecture distills massive codebases into focused solution design
- Prevents architectural drift and ensures consistency
- Fewer surprises and less rework during implementation
- Faster overall delivery (planning investment pays off!)
- Better code quality and maintainability

🤖 **Agent Support:** Exceptional - AI becomes a true coding partner with full context

{{#if brownfield}}
💡 **Why Architecture for Brownfield?**
Your brownfield documentation might be huge (thousands of lines). The Architecture
workflow takes all that context and creates a SUCCINCT solution design specific to
YOUR project. This keeps AI agents focused on YOUR changes without getting lost
in the existing codebase details.
{{/if}}

**Example:** "User dashboard with analytics" or "Payment integration system"
or "Add real-time collaboration to existing editor"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

🏢 **BMad Enterprise Method** - Extended Enterprise Planning

⏱️ **Time:** 3-7 days of planning
📝 **Approach:** BMad Method + Security Architecture + DevOps + Test Strategy
✅ **Best for:** Enterprise requirements, compliance, multi-tenant, mission-critical
✅ **Benefits:** All of BMad Method PLUS specialized planning for:

- Security architecture and threat modeling
- DevOps pipeline and infrastructure planning
- Comprehensive test strategy
- Compliance and audit requirements

🤖 **Agent Support:** Elite - comprehensive planning for complex enterprise systems

**Example:** "Multi-tenant SaaS platform" or "HIPAA-compliant patient portal"
or "Add SOC2-compliant audit logging to enterprise app"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━</output>

<action>Generate recommendation based on user_description and field_type:

**Recommendation Logic:**

- Complexity keywords (dashboard, platform, system, integration, multiple features) → Recommend BMad Method
- Simple keywords (fix, bug, add button, simple) → Mention Quick Flow as option
- Enterprise keywords (multi-tenant, compliance, security, audit) → Recommend Enterprise
- Brownfield + complex → Strongly recommend Method (explain architecture benefit)
- Greenfield + complex → Recommend Method
