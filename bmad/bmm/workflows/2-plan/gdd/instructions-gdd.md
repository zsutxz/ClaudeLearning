# GDD Workflow - Game Projects (All Levels)

<workflow>

<critical>The workflow execution engine is governed by: {project_root}/bmad/core/tasks/workflow.md</critical>
<critical>You MUST have already loaded and processed: {installed_path}/workflow.yaml</critical>
<critical>This is the GDD instruction set for GAME projects - replaces PRD with Game Design Document</critical>
<critical>Project analysis already completed - proceeding with game-specific design</critical>
<critical>Uses gdd_template for GDD output, game_types.csv for type-specific sections</critical>
<critical>Routes to 3-solutioning for architecture (platform-specific decisions handled there)</critical>
<critical>If users mention technical details, append to technical_preferences with timestamp</critical>

<step n="1" goal="Load context and determine game type">

## Next Steps for {{game_name}}

<check>If needs_narrative == true:</check>
<ask>This game type ({{game_type}}) is **{{narrative_importance}}** for narrative.

Your game would benefit from a Narrative Design Document to detail:

- Story structure and beats
- Character profiles and arcs
- World lore and history
- Dialogue framework
- Environmental storytelling

Would you like to create a Narrative Design Document now?

1. Yes, create Narrative Design Document (recommended)
2. No, proceed directly to solutioning
3. Skip for now, I'll do it later

Your choice:</ask>

<check>If user selects option 1:</check>
<action>LOAD: {installed_path}/narrative/instructions-narrative.md</action>
<action>Pass GDD context to narrative workflow</action>
<action>Exit current workflow (narrative will hand off to solutioning when done)</action>

Since this is a Level {{project_level}} game project, you need solutioning for platform/engine architecture.

**Start new chat with solutioning workflow and provide:**

1. This GDD: `{{gdd_output_file}}`
2. Project analysis: `{{analysis_file}}`

**The solutioning workflow will:**

- Determine game engine/platform (Unity, Godot, Phaser, custom, etc.)
- Generate solution-architecture.md with engine-specific decisions
- Create per-epic tech specs
- Handle platform-specific architecture (from registry.csv game-\* entries)
