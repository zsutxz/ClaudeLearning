# Project Planning Workflow

## Overview

Scale-adaptive project planning workflow that automatically adjusts outputs based on project scope - from single atomic changes (Level 0: tech-spec only) to enterprise platforms (Level 4: full PRD + epics). Generates appropriate planning artifacts for each level with intelligent routing and continuation support.

## Key Features

- **Scale-adaptive planning** - Automatically determines output based on project complexity
- **Intelligent routing** - Uses router system to load appropriate instruction sets
- **Continuation support** - Can resume from previous sessions and handle incremental work
- **Multi-level outputs** - Supports 5 project levels (0-4) with appropriate artifacts
- **Input integration** - Leverages product briefs and market research when available
- **Template-driven** - Uses validated templates for consistent output structure

## Usage

### Basic Invocation

```bash
workflow plan-project
```

### With Input Documents

```bash
# With product brief as input
workflow plan-project --input /path/to/product-brief.md

# With multiple inputs
workflow plan-project --input product-brief.md --input market-research.md
```

### Configuration

The workflow adapts automatically based on project assessment, but key configuration options include:

- **scale_parameters**: Defines story/epic counts for each project level
- **output_folder**: Where all generated documents are stored
- **project_name**: Used in document names and templates

## Workflow Process

### Phase 1: Assessment and Routing (Steps 1-5)

- **Project Analysis**: Determines project type (greenfield/brownfield/legacy)
- **Scope Assessment**: Classifies into 5 levels based on complexity
- **Document Discovery**: Identifies existing inputs and documentation
- **Workflow Routing**: Loads appropriate instruction set based on level
- **Continuation Handling**: Resumes from previous work when applicable

### Phase 2: Level-Specific Planning (Steps vary by level)

**Level 0 (Single Atomic Change)**:

- Creates technical specification only
- Focuses on implementation details for small changes

**Level 1-2 (Features and Small Systems)**:

- Generates minimal PRD with core sections
- Creates comprehensive tech-spec
- Includes basic epic breakdown

**Level 3-4 (Full Products and Platforms)**:

- Produces complete PRD with all sections
- Generates detailed epic breakdown
- Includes architect handoff materials
- Creates traceability mapping

### Phase 3: Validation and Handoff (Final steps)

- **Document Review**: Validates outputs against checklists
- **Architect Preparation**: For Level 3-4, prepares handoff materials
- **Next Steps**: Provides guidance for development phase

## Output

### Generated Files

- **Primary output**: PRD.md (except Level 0), tech-spec.md, project-workflow-analysis.md
- **Supporting files**: epics.md (Level 3-4), PRD-validation-report.md (if validation run)

### Output Structure by Level

**Level 0 - Tech Spec Only**:

1. **Technical Overview** - Implementation approach
2. **Detailed Design** - Code-level specifications
3. **Testing Strategy** - Validation approach

**Level 1-2 - Minimal PRD + Tech Spec**:

1. **Problem Statement** - Core issue definition
2. **Solution Overview** - High-level approach
3. **Requirements** - Functional and non-functional
4. **Technical Specification** - Implementation details
5. **Success Criteria** - Acceptance criteria

**Level 3-4 - Full PRD + Epics**:

1. **Executive Summary** - Project overview
2. **Problem Definition** - Detailed problem analysis
3. **Solution Architecture** - Comprehensive solution design
4. **User Experience** - Journey mapping and wireframes
5. **Requirements** - Complete functional/non-functional specs
6. **Epic Breakdown** - Development phases and stories
7. **Technical Handoff** - Architecture and implementation guidance

## Requirements

- **Input Documents**: Product brief and/or market research (recommended but not required)
- **Project Configuration**: Valid config.yaml with project_name and output_folder
- **Assessment Readiness**: Clear understanding of project scope and objectives

## Best Practices

### Before Starting

1. **Gather Context**: Collect any existing product briefs, market research, or requirements
2. **Define Scope**: Have a clear sense of project boundaries and complexity
3. **Prepare Stakeholders**: Ensure key stakeholders are available for input if needed

### During Execution

1. **Be Honest About Scope**: Accurate assessment ensures appropriate planning depth
2. **Leverage Existing Work**: Reference previous documents and avoid duplication
3. **Think Incrementally**: Remember that planning can evolve - start with what you know

### After Completion

1. **Validate Against Checklist**: Use included validation criteria to ensure completeness
2. **Share with Stakeholders**: Distribute appropriate documents to relevant team members
3. **Prepare for Architecture**: For Level 3-4 projects, ensure architect has complete context

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Workflow creates wrong level of documentation

- **Solution**: Review project assessment and restart with correct scope classification
- **Check**: Verify the project-workflow-analysis.md reflects actual project complexity

**Issue**: Missing input documents cause incomplete planning

- **Solution**: Gather recommended inputs or proceed with manual context gathering
- **Check**: Ensure critical business context is captured even without formal documents

**Issue**: Continuation from previous session fails

- **Solution**: Check for existing project-workflow-analysis.md and ensure output folder is correct
- **Check**: Verify previous session completed at a valid checkpoint

## Customization

To customize this workflow:

1. **Modify Assessment Logic**: Update instructions-router.md to adjust level classification
2. **Adjust Templates**: Customize PRD, tech-spec, or epic templates for organizational needs
3. **Add Validation**: Extend checklist.md with organization-specific quality criteria
4. **Configure Outputs**: Modify workflow.yaml to change file naming or structure
