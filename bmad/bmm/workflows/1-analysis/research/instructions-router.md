<step n="1" goal="Welcome and Research Type Selection">
<action>Welcome the user to the Research Workflow</action>

**The Research Workflow supports multiple research types:**

Present the user with research type options:

**What type of research do you need?**

1. **Market Research** - Comprehensive market analysis with TAM/SAM/SOM calculations, competitive intelligence, customer segments, and go-to-market strategy
   - Use for: Market opportunity assessment, competitive landscape analysis, market sizing
   - Output: Detailed market research report with financials

2. **Deep Research Prompt Generator** - Create structured, multi-step research prompts optimized for AI platforms (ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, Claude)
   - Use for: Generating comprehensive research prompts, structuring complex investigations
   - Output: Optimized research prompt with framework, scope, and validation criteria

3. **Technical/Architecture Research** - Evaluate technology stacks, architecture patterns, frameworks, and technical approaches
   - Use for: Tech stack decisions, architecture pattern selection, framework evaluation
   - Output: Technical research report with recommendations and trade-off analysis

4. **Competitive Intelligence** - Deep dive into specific competitors, their strategies, products, and market positioning
   - Use for: Competitor deep dives, competitive strategy analysis
   - Output: Competitive intelligence report

5. **User Research** - Customer insights, personas, jobs-to-be-done, and user behavior analysis
   - Use for: Customer discovery, persona development, user journey mapping
   - Output: User research report with personas and insights

6. **Domain/Industry Research** - Deep dive into specific industries, domains, or subject matter areas
   - Use for: Industry analysis, domain expertise building, trend analysis
   - Output: Domain research report
