# Tech-Spec Workflow - Context-Aware Technical Planning (Level 0-1)

<workflow>

<critical>The workflow execution engine is governed by: {project-root}/bmad/core/tasks/workflow.xml</critical>
<critical>You MUST have already loaded and processed: {installed_path}/workflow.yaml</critical>
<critical>Communicate all responses in {communication_language} and language MUST be tailored to {user_skill_level}</critical>
<critical>Generate all documents in {document_output_language}</critical>
<critical>This is for Level 0-1 projects - tech-spec with context-rich story generation</critical>
<critical>Level 0: tech-spec + single user story | Level 1: tech-spec + epic/stories</critical>
<critical>LIVING DOCUMENT: Write to tech-spec.md continuously as you discover - never wait until the end</critical>
<critical>CONTEXT IS KING: Gather ALL available context before generating specs</critical>
<critical>DOCUMENT OUTPUT: Technical, precise, definitive. Specific versions only. User skill level ({user_skill_level}) affects conversation style ONLY, not document content.</critical>
<critical>Input documents specified in workflow.yaml input_file_patterns - workflow engine handles fuzzy matching, whole vs sharded document discovery automatically</critical>

<step n="1" goal="Comprehensive context discovery - gather everything available">

<action>Welcome {user_name} warmly and explain what we're about to do:

"I'm going to gather all available context about your project before we dive into the technical spec. This includes:

- Any existing documentation (product briefs, research)
- Brownfield codebase analysis (if applicable)
- Your project's tech stack and dependencies
- Existing code patterns and structure

This ensures the tech-spec is grounded in reality and gives developers everything they need."
</action>

<action>**PHASE 1: Load Existing Documents**

Search for and load (using dual-strategy: whole first, then sharded):

1. **Product Brief:**
   - Search pattern: {output*folder}/\_brief*.md
   - Sharded: {output*folder}/\_brief*/index.md
   - If found: Load completely and extract key context

2. **Research Documents:**
   - Search pattern: {output*folder}/\_research*.md
   - Sharded: {output*folder}/\_research*/index.md
   - If found: Load completely and extract insights

3. **Document-Project Output (CRITICAL for brownfield):**
   - Always check: {output_folder}/docs/index.md
   - If found: This is the brownfield codebase map - load ALL shards!
   - Extract: File structure, key modules, existing patterns, naming conventions

Create a summary of what was found:

- List of loaded documents
- Key insights from each
- Brownfield vs greenfield determination
  </action>

<action>**PHASE 2: Detect Project Type from Setup Files**

Search for project setup files in {project-root}:

**Node.js/JavaScript:**

- package.json → Parse for framework, dependencies, scripts

**Python:**

- requirements.txt → Parse for packages
- pyproject.toml → Parse for modern Python projects
- Pipfile → Parse for pipenv projects

**Ruby:**

- Gemfile → Parse for gems and versions

**Java:**

- pom.xml → Parse for Maven dependencies
- build.gradle → Parse for Gradle dependencies

**Go:**

- go.mod → Parse for modules

**Rust:**

- Cargo.toml → Parse for crates

**PHP:**

- composer.json → Parse for packages

If setup file found, extract:

1. Framework name and EXACT version (e.g., "React 18.2.0", "Django 4.2.1")
2. All production dependencies with versions
3. Dev dependencies and tools (TypeScript, Jest, ESLint, pytest, etc.)
4. Available scripts (npm run test, npm run build, etc.)
5. Project type indicators (is it an API? Web app? CLI tool?)
6. **Test framework** (Jest, pytest, RSpec, JUnit, Mocha, etc.)

**Check for Outdated Dependencies:**
<check if="major framework version > 2 years old">
<action>Use WebSearch to find current recommended version</action>
<example>
If package.json shows "react": "16.14.0" (from 2020):
<WebSearch query="React latest stable version 2025 migration guide" />
Note both current version AND migration complexity in stack summary
</example>
</check>

**For Greenfield Projects:**
<check if="field_type == greenfield">
<action>Use WebSearch for current best practices AND starter templates</action>
<example>
<WebSearch query="{detected_framework} best practices {current_year}" />
<WebSearch query="{detected_framework} recommended packages {current_year}" />
<WebSearch query="{detected_framework} official starter template {current_year}" />
<WebSearch query="{project_type} {detected_framework} boilerplate {current_year}" />
</example>

**RECOMMEND STARTER TEMPLATES:**
Look for official or well-maintained starter templates:

- React: Create React App, Vite, Next.js starter
- Vue: create-vue, Nuxt starter
- Python: cookiecutter templates, FastAPI template
- Node.js: express-generator, NestJS CLI
- Ruby: Rails new, Sinatra template
- Go: go-blueprint, standard project layout

Benefits of starters:

- ✅ Modern best practices baked in
- ✅ Proper project structure
- ✅ Build tooling configured
- ✅ Testing framework set up
- ✅ Linting/formatting included
- ✅ Faster time to first feature

**Present recommendations to user:**
"I found these starter templates for {{framework}}:

1. {{official_template}} - Official, well-maintained
2. {{community_template}} - Popular community template

These provide {{benefits}}. Would you like to use one? (yes/no/show-me-more)"

<action>Capture user preference on starter template</action>
<action>If yes, include starter setup in implementation stack</action>
</check>

Store this as {{project_stack_summary}}
</action>

<action>**PHASE 3: Brownfield Codebase Reconnaissance** (if applicable)

<check if="field_type == brownfield OR document-project output found">

Analyze the existing project structure:

1. **Directory Structure:**
   - Identify main code directories (src/, lib/, app/, components/, services/)
   - Note organization patterns (feature-based, layer-based, domain-driven)
   - Identify test directories and patterns

2. **Code Patterns:**
   - Look for dominant patterns (class-based, functional, MVC, microservices)
   - Identify naming conventions (camelCase, snake_case, PascalCase)
   - Note file organization patterns

3. **Key Modules/Services:**
   - Identify major modules or services already in place
   - Note entry points (main.js, app.py, index.ts)
   - Document important utilities or shared code

4. **Testing Patterns & Standards (CRITICAL):**
   - Identify test framework in use (from package.json/requirements.txt)
   - Note test file naming patterns (.test.js, \_test.py, .spec.ts, Test.java)
   - Document test organization (tests/, **tests**, spec/, test/)
   - Look for test configuration files (jest.config.js, pytest.ini, .rspec)
   - Check for coverage requirements (in CI config, test scripts)
   - Identify mocking/stubbing libraries (jest.mock, unittest.mock, sinon)
   - Note assertion styles (expect, assert, should)

5. **Code Style & Conventions (MUST CONFORM):**
   - Check for linter config (.eslintrc, .pylintrc, rubocop.yml)
   - Check for formatter config (.prettierrc, .black, .editorconfig)
   - Identify code style:
     - Semicolons: yes/no (JavaScript/TypeScript)
     - Quotes: single/double
     - Indentation: spaces/tabs, size
     - Line length limits
   - Import/export patterns (named vs default, organization)
   - Error handling patterns (try/catch, Result types, error classes)
   - Logging patterns (console, winston, logging module, specific formats)
   - Documentation style (JSDoc, docstrings, YARD, JavaDoc)

Store this as {{existing_structure_summary}}

**CRITICAL: Confirm Conventions with User**
<ask>I've detected these conventions in your codebase:

**Code Style:**
{{detected_code_style}}

**Test Patterns:**
{{detected_test_patterns}}

**File Organization:**
{{detected_file_organization}}

Should I follow these existing conventions for the new code?

Enter **yes** to conform to existing patterns, or **no** if you want to establish new standards:</ask>

<action>Capture user response as conform_to_conventions (yes/no)</action>

<check if="conform_to_conventions == no">
  <ask>What conventions would you like to use instead? (Or should I suggest modern best practices?)</ask>

<action>**PHASE 4: Synthesize Context Summary**

Create {{loaded_documents_summary}} that includes:

- Documents found and loaded
- Brownfield vs greenfield status
- Tech stack detected (or "To be determined" if greenfield)
- Existing patterns identified (or "None - greenfield" if applicable)

Present this summary to {user_name} conversationally:

"Here's what I found about your project:

**Documents Available:**
[List what was found]

**Project Type:**
[Brownfield with X framework Y version OR Greenfield - new project]

**Existing Stack:**

- Verify brownfield analysis (if applicable)

**Section 3: Tech-Spec Definitiveness**

- Scan for "or" statements (FAIL if found)
- Verify all versions are specific
- Check stack alignment

**Section 4: Context-Rich Content**

- Verify all new template sections populated
- Check existing code references (brownfield)
- Validate framework dependencies listed

**Section 5-6: Story Quality (deferred to Step 5)**

**Section 7: Workflow Status (if applicable)**

**What Makes This Tech-Spec Special:**

The tech-spec is comprehensive enough to serve as the primary context document:

- ✨ Brownfield codebase analysis (if applicable)
- ✨ Exact framework and library versions from your project
- ✨ Existing patterns and code references
- ✨ Specific file paths and integration points
- ✨ Complete developer resources

**Next Steps:**

<check if="project_level == 0">
**For Single Story (Level 0):**

**Option A - With Story Context (for complex changes):**

1. Ask SM agent to run `create-story-context` for the story
   - This generates additional XML context if needed
2. Then ask DEV agent to run `dev-story` to implement

**Option B - Direct to Dev (most Level 0):**

1. Ask DEV agent to run `dev-story` directly
   - Tech-spec provides all the context needed!
   - Story is ready to implement

💡 **Tip:** Most Level 0 changes don't need separate story context since tech-spec is comprehensive!
</check>

<check if="project_level == 1">
**For Multiple Stories (Level 1):**

**Recommended: Story-by-Story Approach**

For the **first story** ({{first_story_name}}):

**Option A - With Story Context (recommended for first story):**

1. Ask SM agent to run `create-story-context` for story 1
   - Generates focused context for this specific story
2. Then ask DEV agent to run `dev-story` to implement story 1

**Option B - Direct to Dev:**

1. Ask DEV agent to run `dev-story` for story 1
   - Tech-spec has most context needed

After completing story 1, repeat for stories 2 and 3.

**Alternative: Sprint Planning Approach**

- If managing multiple stories as a sprint, ask SM agent to run `sprint-planning`
- This organizes all stories for coordinated implementation
  </check>

**Your Tech-Spec:**

- 📄 Saved to: `{output_folder}/tech-spec.md`
- Contains: All context, decisions, patterns, and implementation guidance
- Ready for: Direct development or story context generation

The tech-spec is your single source of truth! 🚀
