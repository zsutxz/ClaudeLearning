# PRD Workflow - Intent-Driven Product Planning

<critical>The workflow execution engine is governed by: {project-root}/bmad/core/tasks/workflow.xml</critical>
<critical>You MUST have already loaded and processed: {installed_path}/workflow.yaml</critical>
<critical>This workflow uses INTENT-DRIVEN PLANNING - adapt organically to product type and context</critical>
<critical>Communicate all responses in {communication_language} and adapt deeply to {user_skill_level}</critical>
<critical>Generate all documents in {document_output_language}</critical>
<critical>LIVING DOCUMENT: Write to PRD.md continuously as you discover - never wait until the end</critical>
<critical>GUIDING PRINCIPLE: Find and weave the product's magic throughout - what makes it special should inspire every section</critical>
<critical>Input documents specified in workflow.yaml input_file_patterns - workflow engine handles fuzzy matching, whole vs sharded document discovery automatically</critical>

<step n="1" goal="Discovery - Project, Domain, and Vision">
<action>Welcome {user_name} and begin comprehensive discovery, and then start to GATHER ALL CONTEXT:
1. Check workflow-status.yaml for project_context (if exists)
2. Look for existing documents (Product Brief, Domain Brief, research)
3. Detect project type AND domain complexity

Load references:
{installed_path}/project-types.csv
{installed_path}/domain-complexity.csv

Through natural conversation:
"Tell me about what you want to build - what problem does it solve and for whom?"

DUAL DETECTION:
Project type signals: API, mobile, web, CLI, SDK, SaaS
Domain complexity signals: medical, finance, government, education, aerospace

SPECIAL ROUTING:
If game detected → Inform user that game development requires the BMGD module (BMad Game Development)
If complex domain detected → Offer domain research options:
A) Run domain-research workflow (thorough)
B) Quick web search (basic)
C) User provides context
D) Continue with general knowledge

CAPTURE THE MAGIC EARLY with a few questions such as for example: "What excites you most about this product?", "What would make users love this?", "What's the moment that will make people go 'wow'?"

This excitement becomes the thread woven throughout the PRD.</action>

<step n="2" goal="Success Definition">
<action>Define what winning looks like for THIS specific product

INTENT: Meaningful success criteria, not generic metrics

Adapt to context:

- Consumer: User love, engagement, retention
- B2B: ROI, efficiency, adoption
- Developer tools: Developer experience, community
- Regulated: Compliance, safety, validation

Make it specific:

- NOT: "10,000 users"
- BUT: "100 power users who rely on it daily"

- NOT: "99.9% uptime"
- BUT: "Zero data loss during critical operations"

Weave in the magic:

<step n="3" goal="Scope Definition">
<action>Smart scope negotiation - find the sweet spot

The Scoping Game:

1. "What must work for this to be useful?" → MVP
2. "What makes it competitive?" → Growth
3. "What's the dream version?" → Vision

Challenge scope creep conversationally:

- "Could that wait until after launch?"
- "Is that essential for proving the concept?"

For complex domains:

- Include compliance minimums in MVP
- Note regulatory gates between phases</action>

<step n="4" goal="Domain-Specific Exploration" optional="true">
<action>Only if complex domain detected or domain-brief exists

Synthesize domain requirements that will shape everything:

- Regulatory requirements
- Compliance needs
- Industry standards
- Safety/risk factors
- Required validations
- Special expertise needed

These inform:

- What features are mandatory
- What NFRs are critical
- How to sequence development
- What validation is required</action>

<step n="5" goal="Innovation Discovery" optional="true">
<action>Identify truly novel patterns if applicable

Listen for innovation signals:

- "Nothing like this exists"
- "We're rethinking how [X] works"
- "Combining [A] with [B] for the first time"

Explore deeply:

- What makes it unique?
- What assumption are you challenging?
- How do we validate it?
- What's the fallback?

<step n="6" goal="Project-Specific Deep Dive">
<action>Based on detected project type, dive deep into specific needs

Load project type requirements from CSV and expand naturally.

FOR API/BACKEND:

- Map out endpoints, methods, parameters
- Define authentication and authorization
- Specify error codes and rate limits
- Document data schemas

FOR MOBILE:

- Platform requirements (iOS/Android/both)
- Device features needed
- Offline capabilities
- Store compliance

FOR SAAS B2B:

- Multi-tenant architecture
- Permission models
- Subscription tiers
- Critical integrations

- Project-type specific needs
- Innovation requirements

Organize by capability, not technology:

- User Management (not "auth system")
- Content Discovery (not "search algorithm")
- Team Collaboration (not "websockets")

Each requirement should:

- Be specific and measurable
- Connect to user value
- Include acceptance criteria
- Note domain constraints

Which would you prefer?"

If new session:

<output>**✅ PRD Complete, {user_name}!**

Your product requirements are documented and ready for implementation.

**Created:**

- **PRD.md** - Complete requirements adapted to {project_type} and {domain}

**Next Steps:**

1. **Epic Breakdown** (Required)
   Run: `workflow create-epics-and-stories` to decompose requirements into implementable stories

2. **UX Design** (If UI exists)
   Run: `workflow ux-design` for detailed user experience design

3. **Architecture** (Recommended)
   Run: `workflow create-architecture` for technical architecture decisions

The magic of your product - {product_magic_summary} - is woven throughout the PRD and will guide all subsequent work.
