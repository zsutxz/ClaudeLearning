# Story 1.1: Enhanced Coin Animation System

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** game developer,
**I want** to implement an enhanced coin flying animation system using DOTween with object pooling,
**so that** I can create visually appealing coin collection animations in Unity games with efficient performance.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Coin flying animation works as a prefab that can be instantiated
2. Object pooling system manages coin lifecycle efficiently
3. Animation includes movement, rotation, and scaling effects
4. Parameters are configurable in the Unity Inspector
5. System can handle multiple simultaneous coin animations
6. No memory leaks or performance degradation with many coins
7. Code follows Unity best practices and DOTween conventions
8. Implementation works with URP

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1: Set up DOTween in Unity project
  - [ ] Add DOTween package to project (manual installation)
  - [ ] Verify DOTween installation and initialization
  - [ ] Configure DOTween settings for safe mode

- [ ] Task 2: Create Coin component
  - [ ] Modify existing CoinAnimationController to be Coin component
  - [ ] Implement DOTween sequence for flying animation
  - [ ] Add self-deactivation when animation completes
  - [ ] Bind parameters to Unity Inspector

- [ ] Task 3: Create coin prefab
  - [ ] Create prefab from coin GameObject
  - [ ] Configure components and references
  - [ ] Verify prefab works when instantiated

- [ ] Task 4: Implement object pool manager
  - [ ] Create CoinPoolManager script
  - [ ] Implement pool initialization with initial coins
  - [ ] Add methods to get/return coins from pool
  - [ ] Track active coins to prevent leaks

- [ ] Task 5: Create coin animation system
  - [ ] Develop CoinAnimationSystem for high-level control
  - [ ] Implement methods to spawn coin animations
  - [ ] Connect with pool manager for coin retrieval

- [ ] Task 6: Implement flying animation with pooling
  - [ ] Modify animation sequence to work with pooled coins
  - [ ] Ensure coins return to pool after animation
  - [ ] Handle edge cases and error conditions

- [ ] Task 7: Test and validate implementation
  - [ ] Verify prefab instantiation works correctly
  - [ ] Test object pooling with multiple coins
  - [ ] Validate memory management and performance
  - [ ] Confirm URP compatibility

## Dev Notes
The implementation should focus on creating a reusable and efficient coin animation system for Unity games. The system should leverage DOTween for smooth animations and object pooling to manage performance when many coins are active simultaneously.

```

### Technical Requirements
- Use Unity 2021.3 LTS or later
- Implement DOTween Pro v1.2.715 or later
- Target URP (Universal Render Pipeline) compatibility
- Follow Unity best practices for component design
- Ensure proper memory management with object pooling

## Testing
- Test prefab instantiation and configuration
- Verify object pooling functionality with pool statistics
- Test animation parameters in Unity Inspector
- Validate performance with multiple concurrent animations
- Confirm URP compatibility and rendering
- Check for memory leaks during extended usage

### Test File Location
- Tests should be integrated with existing Unity test framework
- Performance tests should monitor frame rate and memory usage
- Unit tests should verify individual component functionality

### Test Standards
- Follow Unity testing best practices
- Use Unity Test Framework for automated testing
- Implement performance benchmarks for animation system
- Validate memory usage patterns with Unity Profiler

### Testing Frameworks and Patterns
- Unity Test Framework for unit and integration tests
- Unity Profiler for performance monitoring
- Manual playtesting for visual verification
- Automated performance benchmarks

### Specific Testing Requirements
- Verify coin prefab works correctly when instantiated
- Test object pooling with varying numbers of coins
- Validate animation smoothness and visual quality
- Confirm no memory leaks during extended usage
- Test error handling for edge cases
