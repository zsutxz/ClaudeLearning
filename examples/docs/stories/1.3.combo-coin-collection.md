# Story 1.3: Combo Coin Collection

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** game player,
**I want** to see special visual effects when I collect multiple coins in quick succession,
**so that** I feel rewarded for my skill and maintain engagement in the game.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. When a player collects coins in quick succession (combo), special visual effects are triggered
2. The combo counter increases with each consecutive coin collection within a time window
3. Visual effects become more impressive as the combo count increases
4. Combo effects include particle systems, screen shakes, or other engaging visuals
5. The combo resets after a specified time period without coin collection
6. Different combo levels have distinct visual and audio effects
7. Combo information is displayed to the player
8. Performance is maintained even with complex combo effects

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Task 1: Design combo system mechanics (AC: 1, 2, 5)
  - [ ] Define combo time window (e.g., 2 seconds between coin collections)
  - [ ] Determine combo levels and thresholds (e.g., x2, x3, x5, x10)
  - [ ] Design combo reset behavior

- [ ] Task 2: Implement combo counter logic (AC: 2, 5)
  - [ ] Create combo manager system to track consecutive coin collections
  - [ ] Implement time-based combo reset functionality
  - [ ] Add methods to increment and reset combo counter

- [ ] Task 3: Create combo visual effects (AC: 1, 3, 4, 6)
  - [ ] Design particle effects for different combo levels
  - [ ] Implement screen shake effects that intensify with combo level
  - [ ] Add special animations for high combo achievements
  - [ ] Create visual indicators for combo levels

- [ ] Task 4: Integrate combo audio effects (AC: 6)
  - [ ] Add different sound effects for each combo level
  - [ ] Implement audio variations that intensify with combo progression
  - [ ] Create special sounds for combo milestones

- [ ] Task 5: Display combo information to player (AC: 7)
  - [ ] Create UI element to show current combo count
  - [ ] Add visual feedback when combo increases
  - [ ] Show combo multipliers or bonuses

- [ ] Task 6: Optimize performance with complex effects (AC: 8)
  - [ ] Test performance with multiple combo effects active
  - [ ] Implement effect pooling for particles and animations
  - [ ] Optimize rendering for mobile devices

- [ ] Task 7: Test and validate combo system (AC: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8)
  - [ ] Verify combo counter increases correctly with quick coin collections
  - [ ] Test combo reset behavior after time window expires
  - [ ] Validate visual effects scale appropriately with combo level
  - [ ] Confirm performance remains stable with complex effects
  - [ ] Test on different devices for compatibility

## Dev Notes
This story extends the existing coin collection system with combo mechanics to enhance player engagement. The implementation should build upon the previous coin animation and visual effects work.

### Technical Requirements
- Extend existing coin collection system with combo mechanics
- Use Unity's particle system for combo visual effects
- Implement proper timing logic for combo detection
- Follow Unity best practices for performance optimization
- Integrate with existing URP setup
- Use object pooling for particle effects to maintain performance

### Previous Story Insights
The previous stories (1.1 and 1.2) established the core coin animation system with object pooling and visual effects for individual coin collection. This story builds upon that foundation by adding temporal mechanics and more complex visual/audio feedback.

Key learnings from previous implementations:
- DOTween animations need proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks
- Object pooling significantly improves performance with many simultaneous effects
- URP compatibility was successfully achieved
- Inspector parameters provide good configurability for effects
- Mobile optimization is crucial for maintaining performance

### Language Strategy
- Use C# for all new script implementations
- Leverage existing DOTween implementation for animations
- Use Unity's built-in particle system for visual effects
- Follow existing code patterns in the codebase

### Node Architecture
- Extend CoinAnimationSystem to integrate with combo mechanics
- Create ComboManager as a singleton or scriptable object
- Add particle system components for combo effects
- Implement UI elements for combo display

### Scene Specifications
- Add combo particle effects to existing scenes
- Configure particle system prefabs with appropriate settings
- Set up UI elements for combo display in the canvas
- Ensure effects are properly positioned in world space

### Input Configuration
- No new input methods required - combo system is time-based
- Existing coin collection triggers will integrate with combo system

### UI Implementation
- Create UI panel to display current combo count
- Add visual feedback animations for combo increases
- Design scalable UI that works on different screen sizes
- Implement proper anchoring for combo display elements

### Resource Pipeline
- Create particle effect prefabs for different combo levels
- Add audio clips for combo sound effects
- Configure import settings for new assets
- Implement pooling strategy for particle systems

### Performance Targets
- Maintain 60+ FPS on target mobile devices
- Keep memory usage stable with many combo effects
- Limit particle system complexity to maintain performance
- Optimize effect rendering with appropriate LOD settings

### Platform Considerations
- Test on iOS and Android devices
- Verify performance on different hardware tiers
- Implement quality settings for lower-end devices
- Ensure compatibility with WebGL builds

### TDD Requirements
- Write unit tests for combo counter logic
- Test combo reset timing functionality
- Validate integration with existing coin collection system
- Verify performance benchmarks are maintained

## Testing
- Test combo counter increases with quick coin collections
- Verify combo reset after time window expires
- Validate visual effects scale with combo level
- Test audio effects for different combo levels
- Confirm performance with multiple combo effects
- Verify UI display updates correctly

### Test File Location
- Tests should be integrated with existing Unity test framework in the UnityProject
- Performance tests should use the existing PerformanceMonitor.cs script
- Visual validation through manual playtesting

### Test Standards
- Follow Unity testing best practices
- Use Unity Test Framework for automated testing
- Implement performance benchmarks for combo system
- Validate visual quality through manual testing

### Testing Frameworks and Patterns
- Unity Test Framework for unit and integration tests
- Unity Profiler for performance monitoring
- Manual playtesting for visual verification
- Automated performance benchmarks

### Specific Testing Requirements
- Verify combo counter behavior with different time intervals
- Test combo effects with 20+ simultaneous coins
- Confirm frame rate remains stable with high combo levels
- Validate audio effects play correctly with visual effects
- Test UI display updates with rapid combo changes
