## 9. Approval and Authorization

This budget estimate requires approval from the project sponsor before implementation. Any changes to the budget exceeding 10% of the total amount will require additional approval through the established change control process.

## 10. Conclusion

The estimated budget of $182,770 provides sufficient funding for the successful development and launch of the Unity Coin Animation System. The budget allocation reflects the resource-intensive nature of software development while maintaining appropriate reserves for risk mitigation.

Regular monitoring and control measures will ensure the project stays within budget while delivering the high-quality product outlined in the PRD. The revenue projections indicate a strong potential for return on investment within the first year of launch.
